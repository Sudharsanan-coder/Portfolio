                <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Web Development. I thrive in dynamic, challenging environments that promote continuous learning and innovation. With a solid foundation in programming and a strong curiosity for how technology shapes the world, I actively pursue opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.

My interest in machine learning stems from its ability to extract insights from data, make intelligent predictions, and build systems that can learn and adapt. I enjoy working with algorithms, data structures, and model training techniques, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring new frameworks and tools to expand my skill set. I also take a hands-on approach in web development, with experience building responsive, user-friendly applications using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
